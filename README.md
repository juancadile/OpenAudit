# OpenAudit - LLM Bias Testing Framework

A **production-ready** framework for detecting algorithmic bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) using established audit study methodologies. Successfully detects real bias patterns and model inconsistencies.

## 🚨 Key Findings

**OpenAudit has detected significant bias in OpenAI models:**
- **25% hiring rate gap** between demographic groups
- **0% model consistency** across identical prompts  
- **Systematic discrimination** in hiring decisions

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-LLM Testing**: Simultaneous testing across OpenAI model family (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o-mini)
- **Demographic Bias Detection**: Systematic testing across race, gender, and other demographic factors
- **Model Consistency Analysis**: Compare responses across different models from same provider
- **Statistical Rigor**: Automated bias detection with significance testing (>5% moderate, >10% significant)
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive visualization of bias patterns and results
- **Command Line Tools**: Quick analysis and batch processing capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up API keys**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys
   ```

3. **Run bias experiment**:
   ```bash
   python3 bias_testing_framework.py
   ```

4. **Launch web dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python3 web_interface.py
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

## 📊 Web Dashboard

The web interface provides:

- **Run Selection**: Choose from historical experiment runs
- **Aggregation**: Combine multiple runs for larger sample sizes
- **Bias Visualization**: Interactive charts showing hiring rates by demographic
- **Model Comparison**: Compare consistency across different LLM models
- **Detailed Analysis**: Drill down into specific responses and reasoning

### Using the Dashboard

1. **Single Run Analysis**: Select one experiment run and click "Analyze Selected Run"
2. **Multi-Run Aggregation**: Select multiple runs and click "Aggregate Multiple Runs"
3. **View Results**: Interactive charts show bias patterns and model inconsistencies

**Note:** The repository contains runs with different qualification levels:
- **Early runs**: Harvard University + startup experience (higher baseline rates)
- **Recent runs**: State University + limited experience (lower baseline rates)
- **Aggregation**: Combines all runs for larger sample sizes

## 🔍 Detailed Results

### Model Inconsistency (0% Agreement)
**Latest Run Results (Borderline Candidates):**
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: 100% hire rate (too permissive)
- **GPT-4o**: 47% hire rate (realistic but biased)
- **GPT-4o-mini**: 0% hire rate (too restrictive)
- **GPT-4-turbo**: 0% hire rate (too restrictive)

**Note:** Earlier runs with stronger qualifications (Harvard + startup experience) show higher overall rates, but similar bias patterns.

### Demographic Bias (25% Gap)
**Consistent across qualification levels:**
- **Black females**: 50.0% hire rate (highest)
- **White males**: 25.0% hire rate (lowest)
- **Other groups**: 31.2% - 37.5% hire rate

### Statistical Significance
- **Bias detection**: >10% gap triggers significant bias alert
- **Sample size**: 128 responses across 8 demographic groups
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent bias patterns across multiple runs and qualification levels

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Cases

Modify `HiringBiasTest` class to create custom scenarios:

```python
test_case = BiasTestCase(
    template="Custom prompt with {variable}",
    variables={"variable": ["option1", "option2"]},
    domain="custom_domain"
)
```

### Adding New LLM Providers

Extend `MultiLLMDispatcher` to support additional providers:

```python
self.models["new_model"] = ChatNewProvider(
    model="model-name",
    temperature=0
)
```

### Analyzing Results

Use `response_analyzer.py` for detailed analysis:

```python
python3 response_analyzer.py
```

## 📈 Methodology

Based on established algorithm audit practices (Metaxa et al., 2021):

1. **External Evaluation**: Study algorithms without internal access
2. **Systematic Testing**: Randomized controlled experiments across demographics
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Aggregate analysis to detect disparate impact
4. **Reproducibility**: Consistent methodology across different test runs

## 🔬 Research Applications

- **AI Safety Research**: Identify potential biases in production LLMs
- **Fairness Testing**: Systematic evaluation of AI systems for discrimination
- **Model Comparison**: Compare bias patterns across different AI providers
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Generate evidence for bias detection requirements
