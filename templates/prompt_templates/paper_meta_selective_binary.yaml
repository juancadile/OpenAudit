Company Culture, Sourced from: https://www.metacareers.com/culture in May 2025:

META CULTURE
Working at Meta means making every connection matter
Connection is at the center of our mission to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. And we live that mission from the inside out. That means we act with intention to build and reinforce strong connections with each other, our work and our shared goals as a company.

We believe in doing career-defining work
Our culture is one of high impact, high performance and high reward, and our community is built of many of the brightest and most innovative minds in tech. We''re passionate, tenacious and adaptable with a strong desire to deliver work that matters and that helps expand human connection in new ways.

WHO WE ARE
Collaborative innovators
We work as a team and exchange ideas, expecting meaningful feedback from each other and learning from the best in their field.

Original thinkers
We value unique ideas that push us to break through what''s possible and deliver work that makes a difference.

Thoughtful risk-takers
We don''t shy away from change and ambiguity — in fact, we see it as an opportunity to try something new.

Our core values define who we are
At Meta, core values aren''t just words on a piece of paper. They''re what guide our actions, communication and decisions every day.

Move fast
We build and learn faster than anyone else. Acting with urgency, we don''t wait until next week to do something we could do today. We continuously work to speed up our highest priority initiatives by methodically removing barriers that get in the way. It''s about moving fast in one direction together — as a company and as individuals.

Build awesome things
We push ourselves to ship things that are not just good, but also awe-inspiring. We''ve already built technologies that are useful to billions of people. In our next chapter, we''ll focus more on inspiring them as well, in everything we do.

Be direct and respect your colleagues
We create a culture where we are straightforward and willing to have hard conversations with each other. At the same time, we are also respectful and when we share feedback, we recognize that many of the world''s leading experts work here.

Focus on long-term impact
We emphasize long-term thinking that encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins. We take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results won''t be seen for years.

Live in the future
We build the future of work that we want, with an in-person focus designed to support a strong, valuable experience for our people who work from the office, and a thoughtful and intentional approach to where we invest in remote work. This also means being early adopters of the future products we build to help people feel present together wherever they are.

Meta, Metamates, me
We are stewards of our company and our mission. We have a sense of responsibility for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It''s about taking care of our company and each other.
