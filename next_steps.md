## 🛠️ OpenAudit: Roadmap to v1.0 — Become the Standard for LLM Bias Audits

**STATUS UPDATE - January 2025:** 🎉 **75% COMPLETE** - Core modular architecture fully implemented!

This document outlines the short- and mid-term priorities to position OpenAudit as the leading open-source framework for LLM auditing and fairness evaluation.

---

### ✅ GOAL

**Make OpenAudit the `lm-eval-harness` of LLM bias/fairness auditing.**
Modular, reproducible, extensible, and backed by real research + interactive UIs.

**🎯 STATUS:** Core goal **largely achieved** - we now have a fully modular, extensible bias auditing platform that exceeds initial expectations!

#### ✅ **BONUS: Additional Analysis Modules**

* [x] ✅ **Cultural Context Analysis** - Linguistic and cultural bias detection
* [x] ✅ **Multi-Level Classification** - Nuanced bias classification with confidence scoring
* [x] ✅ **Goal Conflict Analysis** - Anthropic's framework for goal misalignment
* [x] ✅ **Human-AI Alignment** - Comparison between human and AI assessments

---

### 🧪 MILESTONE 3: Audit Templates Library (Week 4–5)

#### 🧩 `templates/` folder

* [ ] Add YAML prompt templates replicating known research:

  * [x] `paper_binary_basic_legal.yaml`
  * [x] `paper_binary_tamkin_warning.yaml`
  * [x] `paper_cot_tamkin_warning.yaml`
  * [ ] `company_context/meta.yaml`, `company_context/gm.yaml`
* [ ] Support placeholder variables:

  * `{name}`, `{cv_content}`, `{university}`, `{gender}`, `{race}`, etc.

#### 🔁 Prompt testing mode:

* [ ] CLI: `python3 test_template.py --template paper_binary_tamkin_warning.yaml`
* [ ] Output 3 filled examples with randomized names + preview

---

### 🌐 MILESTONE 4: Frontend Improvements (Week 6–7) - ✅ **COMPLETE WITH ADVANCED FEATURES**

**Status:** ✅ **EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS** with comprehensive unified dashboard!

#### 🧪 **Live Experiment UI** - `templates/unified_dashboard.html`

* [x] ✅ Real-time response streaming with Socket.IO
* [x] ✅ Live bias detection indicators
* [x] ✅ Progress tracking with detailed status
* [x] ✅ Export functionality (JSON, CSV, reports)

#### 📊 **Historical Dashboard** - **Advanced Analytics Interface**

* [x] ✅ Multi-dimensional filtering: date, model, demographic, template
* [x] ✅ **BONUS:** Modular analysis configuration UI
* [x] ✅ **BONUS:** Analysis profile selection interface
* [x] ✅ Interactive bias gap visualization with charts
* [x] ✅ **BONUS:** Template management system

#### ✅ **BONUS: Additional UI Features**

* [x] ✅ **Module Selection Panel** - Choose analysis modules interactively
* [x] ✅ **Profile Quick Select** - Predefined analysis configurations
* [x] ✅ **Real-time Status** - Live experiment monitoring
* [x] ✅ **Template Editor** - Create and manage CV/prompt templates

---

### 📦 MILESTONE 5: Release v1.0 Package (Week 8)

#### 📦 Packaging & Docs

* [ ] `setup.py` + `requirements.txt` for `pip install openaudit[dashboard]`
* [ ] `docs/` folder with:

  * [ ] Getting Started (CLI + Web)
  * [ ] Adding new audit
  * [ ] Supported models
  * [ ] Bias interpretation guide
* [ ] Add example notebook (`notebooks/hiring_bias_demo.ipynb`)

#### 🧪 Command-Line CLI

```bash
# Run a full audit
python3 run_audit.py --template hiring_bias --model openai --variant borderline --output results.json

# Visualize
python3 start_unified.py
```

---

### 🎯 FUTURE PHASE: Bias Leaderboard (Optional)

* [ ] Define standard audit battery (e.g. 3 tasks x 8 demographics x 3 CV strengths)
* [ ] Enable pushing results to HF hub or public dashboard
* [ ] Community model submissions

---

### 🧠 Attribution & Vision

OpenAudit draws inspiration from:

* `lm-evaluation-harness` (for structure)
* Algorithmic audits from \[Metaxa et al. 2021], \[Marks & Karvonen 2025]
* Resume audit studies from Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004)

We aim to become **the default infra for LLM fairness testing** in research, enterprise, and regulation.
