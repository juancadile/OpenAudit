# OpenAudit - Future Features Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements for OpenAudit. The core functionality is **working today** - these are aspirational features for future development based on user feedback and research needs.

## 🧩 **Modular Analysis Architecture**

**Vision**: A plug-and-play system for bias detection methods

**Planned Features:**
- **Standardized Analysis Modules**: Common interface for custom bias detection methods
- **External Module Support**: Security-validated plugin system for community contributions  
- **Analysis Profiles**: Pre-configured workflows (research_grade, cultural, alignment_focused)
- **Module Registry**: Automatic discovery and validation of analysis components

**Implementation Status**: 🔴 Not Started
- Base interfaces designed but modules not implemented
- Test infrastructure exists but modules return placeholder results

**Example Future API:**
```python
# Vision for modular analysis
from openaudit import ModularBiasAnalyzer

analyzer = ModularBiasAnalyzer(responses)
results = analyzer.run_profile_analysis("research_grade")
# Would run: enhanced_statistics + cultural_context + multi_level_classifier
```

## 🌍 **Advanced Analysis Modules**

### Enhanced Statistical Analysis
**Vision**: Publication-grade statistical rigor
- Multiple comparison corrections (Bonferroni, FDR-BH)
- Effect size calculations with confidence intervals
- Power analysis for sample size planning
- Advanced hypothesis testing

**Status**: 🔴 Stubbed interfaces only

### Cultural Context Analysis  
**Vision**: Cross-cultural and linguistic bias detection
- Cultural sensitivity analysis
- Linguistic register bias detection
- Cross-cultural evaluation contexts
- International name bias patterns

**Status**: 🔴 Not implemented

### Multi-Level Bias Classifier
**Vision**: Hierarchical bias detection with confidence scoring
- Soft bias detection (subtle patterns)
- Intersectional bias analysis
- Confidence-weighted results
- Granular bias categorization

**Status**: 🔴 Interface designed, no implementation

### AI Alignment Analysis
**Vision**: Goal conflict and value alignment testing
- Competing objective detection
- Value alignment measurement
- Goal prioritization analysis
- Ethical framework consistency

**Status**: 🔴 Conceptual stage only

## 🚀 **Performance Optimization**

**Vision**: Handle large-scale bias research efficiently

**Planned Features:**
- **Analysis Caching**: Avoid re-running expensive computations
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded analysis pipeline
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient data structures for large datasets
- **Progressive Results**: Stream results as analysis completes

**Status**: 🔴 Framework exists but not integrated

**Example Future API:**
```python
# Vision for performance features
@cached_analysis(ttl=3600)
def expensive_bias_analysis(responses):
    return detailed_analysis(responses)

# Parallel execution
results = ParallelExecutor().execute_modules_parallel(modules, data)
```

## 📊 **Advanced Reporting**

**Vision**: Publication-ready analysis reports

**Planned Features:**
- **LaTeX Export**: Academic paper-ready tables and figures
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Web-based result exploration
- **Longitudinal Analysis**: Track bias changes over time
- **Cross-Study Comparison**: Compare results across experiments

**Status**: 🔴 Basic web interface exists, advanced features planned

## 🔌 **Research Collaboration Tools**

**Vision**: Support multi-institutional bias research

**Planned Features:**
- **Shared Module Registry**: Community-contributed analysis methods
- **Reproducible Experiments**: Version-controlled analysis pipelines  
- **Data Sharing**: Standardized bias dataset formats
- **Citation Integration**: Automatic academic attribution

**Status**: 🔴 Infrastructure planned, not implemented

## 🎯 **Domain-Specific Extensions**

### Healthcare AI Bias
- Medical terminology bias
- Demographic health disparities
- Clinical decision bias patterns

### Financial Services
- Lending bias detection
- Credit scoring fairness
- Economic demographic analysis

### Educational AI
- Academic assessment bias
- Student evaluation fairness
- Educational opportunity analysis

**Status**: 🔴 Domain templates planned

## 📅 **Development Roadmap**

### Phase 1: Core Stability (✅ Complete)
- ✅ Multi-LLM integration working
- ✅ Basic bias detection functional
- ✅ CV generation and templates
- ✅ Test coverage (61 tests passing)
- ✅ Error handling and validation

### Phase 2: User Feedback (Current)
- 🔄 Gather user requirements from researchers
- 🔄 Identify most valuable missing features
- 🔄 Prioritize development based on actual usage

### Phase 3: Selective Implementation (Future)
- ⏳ Implement highest-priority features first
- ⏳ Build modular architecture incrementally  
- ⏳ Maintain backward compatibility
- ⏳ Add features that users actually request

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Long-term)
- ⏳ Performance optimization for large-scale studies
- ⏳ Cross-institutional collaboration tools
- ⏳ Domain-specific bias detection modules

## 🤝 **Contributing to Future Features**

**We welcome contributions, but with priorities:**

1. **Use the current system** - Help us understand what's missing
2. **Report real needs** - Tell us what bias research requires  
3. **Contribute incrementally** - Add one working feature at a time
4. **Maintain quality** - All new features need tests and documentation

**Not Wanted:**
- Large unfinished feature sets
- Academic experiments without practical application
- Features that complicate the core functionality
- Implementations without corresponding tests

## 📋 **Why This Approach**

**Lessons from initial development:**
- Writing extensive aspirational features led to technical debt
- Users need working tools, not perfect architectures
- Better to build incrementally based on real usage
- Test coverage prevents regression as features are added

**Current philosophy:**
- **Ship working software first**
- **Add complexity only when needed** 
- **Let user needs drive development**
- **Maintain high code quality standards**

## 🎯 **Get Involved**

The best way to influence OpenAudit's future is to **use it for real research** and report what you need. 

**Contact**: Open issues on GitHub describing your bias research needs and we'll prioritize development accordingly.

**Current Status**: OpenAudit provides a solid foundation for AI bias research. These aspirational features will be built based on actual user requirements, not theoretical completeness.

*Focus: Build what researchers actually need, not what sounds impressive in documentation.*
