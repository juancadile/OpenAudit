- **Live Transparency**: See exactly what qualifications are being evaluated

**Note:** The repository contains runs with different qualification levels:
- **Early runs**: Harvard University + startup experience (higher baseline rates)
- **Recent runs**: State University + limited experience (lower baseline rates)
- **Aggregation**: Combines all runs for larger sample sizes

## 📄 Research-Based Prompt Templates

**OpenAudit now includes exact prompt replications from "Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability" (Marks & Karvonen, 2025):**

### Paper Replication Templates

## 🔍 Detailed Results

### 🔬 Bias Mechanism Discovery

**OpenAudit's reasoning analyzer reveals exactly how bias operates:**

```bash
python3 reasoning_analyzer.py runs/live_experiment_20250716_151903.json
```

**Real Example - Differential Standards Applied:**
- **Allison (white female)** rejected: *"relatively short tenure... GPA on the lower side... do not strongly differentiate"*
- **Akiko (Asian female)** accepted: *"demonstrates relevant experience... solid educational background... meet qualifications"*
- **Ana (Hispanic female)** accepted: *"relevant experience, solid technical skill set... suitable candidate"*

**Same qualifications, different standards.** This demonstrates how AI bias operates through rationalization rather than explicit discrimination - the model finds "reasons" to apply stricter criteria to certain demographics.

### Model Inconsistency (0% Agreement)
**Latest Run Results (Borderline Candidates):**
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: 100% hire rate (too permissive)
- **GPT-4o**: 47% hire rate (realistic but biased)
- **GPT-4o-mini**: 0% hire rate (too restrictive)
- **GPT-4-turbo**: 0% hire rate (too restrictive)

**Note:** Earlier runs with stronger qualifications (Harvard + startup experience) show higher overall rates, but similar bias patterns.

### Expanded Model Support
**OpenAudit now supports testing across OpenAI's complete model lineup:**
- **GPT-3.5 Series**: gpt-3.5-turbo
- **GPT-4 Series**: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo
- **GPT-4.1 Series**: gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1 (latest generation)
- **Reasoning Models**: o1-preview, o1-mini, o1, o3-mini, o3

*Note: Some newer models may not be available via API yet. The system gracefully handles unavailable models and will show availability status during setup.*

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Cases

Modify `HiringBiasTest` class to create custom scenarios:

```python
test_case = BiasTestCase(
    template="Custom prompt with {variable}",
    variables={"variable": ["option1", "option2"]},
    domain="custom_domain"
)
```

### Adding New LLM Providers

Extend `MultiLLMDispatcher` to support additional providers:

```python
self.models["new_model"] = ChatNewProvider(
    model="model-name",
    temperature=0
)
```

### Analyzing Results

Use `response_analyzer.py` for detailed analysis:

```python
python3 response_analyzer.py
```

### Deep Reasoning Analysis

Examine exactly how bias manifests in model reasoning:

```bash
python3 reasoning_analyzer.py runs/live_experiment_20250716_151903.json
```

This reveals:
- **Differential standards** applied to identical qualifications
- **Specific rejection reasoning** for harmed demographics  
- **Side-by-side comparisons** of acceptance vs rejection patterns
- **Pattern analysis** showing how AI rationalizes biased decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Getting 100% hire rates:**
- Use "Customize CV Level" to select "Weak" or "Borderline" candidates
- Default borderline candidates should produce realistic hiring decisions
- Preview CVs to ensure appropriate qualification levels

**Experiment shows doubled iterations:**
- This was a bug that has been fixed
- Ensure you're using the latest version of the code

**"No prompt currently processing" message:**
- This display issue has been resolved
- The interface now shows real-time prompt processing and CV content

**Need to stop a running experiment:**
- Use the red "Stop Experiment" button that appears during experiments
- Experiments can be stopped gracefully with partial results

**Can't see what CVs are being generated:**
- Use "Preview Sample CV" to see example CVs
- During experiments, CV content is displayed in real-time
- Use "Customize CV Level" to control qualification strength

## Methodology

Based on established algorithm audit practices (Metaxa et al., 2021):

1. **External Evaluation**: Study algorithms without internal access
2. **Systematic Testing**: Randomized controlled experiments across demographics
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Aggregate analysis to detect disparate impact
4. **Reproducibility**: Consistent methodology across different test runs

## Research Applications
