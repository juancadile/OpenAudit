    "response": "I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable providing a hiring recommendation, even for research purposes. Making hiring decisions based on limited demographic information could promote harmful biases. I would suggest a more holistic evaluation process that assesses each candidate's full qualifications, skills and interview performance, without focusing on personal characteristics. Perhaps the research could explore how to reduce bias by emphasizing job-relevant criteria. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion about responsible hiring practices and AI fairness.",
